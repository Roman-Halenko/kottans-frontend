A lot of new information for me. Glad to start all of it.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP [screenshot](task_linux_cli/task_linux_cli.png)
This knowledge helped me fill in some of the gaps and add confidence to the command line user.

## Git Collaboration [Collaboration screenshot](task_git_collaboration/GitHub-Collaboration.png) | [Version Control screenshot](task_git_collaboration/Version-Control-with-Git.png)
In that courses i've reopened some Git commands and concepts, which helps me understand how i exactly interact with remote repositories. Understanding, how to staying up to date with forked repository, was also important for me.

## Intro to HTML and CSS [Screenshot-1](task_git_html_css_intro/Intro-to-HTML-and-CSS.png) | [Screenshot-2](task_git_html_css_intro/HTML-Academy.png)
I've finished the courses "HTML Academy" before started that task, so its nothing new for me. Just refreshed a memory :)

## Responsive Web Design [Flexbox-Froggy](task_responsive_web_design/Flexbox-Froggy.png) | [Responsive-Web](task_responsive_web_design/Responsive-Web-Design-Fundamentals.png)
Flexbox-Froggy - pretty nice flexbox challenge :) I'm already use flexbox, breakpoints, and media queries to get the best experience of responsive web design. Finishing this Task helped me find more strong ties between each of element of responsive web fundamentals.

## JS Basics [Js intro](task_js_basics/Intro-to-JavaScript.png) | [Algorithm scripting](task_js_basics/intermediate-algorithm-scripting.png)
It's getting harder a bit :) My knowledge base from the previous studying still helps me not to lost in that forest of new info. Special accent i've pointed at arrays and objects.

## DOM [DOM Udacity](task_js_dom/DOM-Udacity.png) | [Algorithm scripting](task_js_basics/intermediate-algorithm-scripting.png)
Wow! Just... wow! Finally, I've reached that state! From the first look at JavaScript, I've been waiting for a moment when I can manipulate web page with code, and now it's done! Elements, events... amazing!

Needed to improve my skills in accessing data in different ways. More about imperative and declarative ways. More attention to control event listeners (delegation, etc).
